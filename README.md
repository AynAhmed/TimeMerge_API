# TimeMerge API

## Introduction

TimeMerge is an API project designed to assist users, especially remote workers across the world in different timezones, in finding the best times to collaborate effectively. When working with a distributed team, coordinating meetings and activities can be challenging due to time zone differences. TimeMerge aims to simplify this process by providing a centralized API that allows users to find overlapping time slots that suit everyone's schedule.
